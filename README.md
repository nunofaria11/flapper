# flapper
A take on the tutorial at [thinkster (flapper-news)](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial/) using [bower](bower.io), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

Instead of using the `ui-router` library (suggested by the author of the tutorial), this project is using the native AngularJS routing mechanisms (in order to be able to divide templates in its own independent `html` file).
